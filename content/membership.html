						<h3>Our Goal: Make Dental Care An Affordable Option For Every Person!</h3>
						<br/>
						<p class="left">Everyone knows that Dental Health is important, and most everyone knows what can happen
								when regular dental checkups do not occur. However, dental insurance is not always affordable,
								and paying a large lump sum at the time of appointment is difficult for many. Membership with
								our Dental Membership Plan simplifies it into a simple annual fee for maximum savings, or it can
								be paid into a reasonable monthly fee that can be easily put into a budget.</p>
						<p class="bold">We Are Not Kidding!!</p>
						<p>We’ve gone the extra mile to develop this plan, because we care about the oral health of this
								community. We know what happens when dental care gets neglected, and we don’t want that
								to happen to you!</p>
						<p class="bold">Another Thing You May Want To Know...</p>
						<p>We are not a corporate run dental practice. We are a <span class="bold">PRIVATE</span> dental practice. We sincerely
								appreciate that you have taken the time to learn about our Dental Membership Plan. <span class="bold">If
								Membership makes sense for you, we are happy to help you get started! Stop by the office or
								click the link below.</span></p>
